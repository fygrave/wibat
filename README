Wireless Burglary Automation Toolkit (wibat) :)


The motivation behind this project was pretty practical: to take over a wireless network quick. (handy)

Uses Dependencies:
------------

Modified version of pyiw http://downloads.emperorlinux.com/contrib/pyiw
pywpa http://downloads.emperorlinux.com/contrib/pywpa

we also use some of anemoclient source snippets
(all in one included here)

Attack methods:
---------------

Plain bruteforce (using standard wifi API)
MAC address takeover

TODO:
-----

Nicer UI ;)



Inner Workings
--------------

So far we are pretty dumb: 

The code is implemented in two parts: actual wireless bruteforcer tool that
deals with wireless card settings and attempts to set proper encryption 
credentials

and connectivity verification module that verifies if the connection was
successeful.

Currently we implement only two verification components: ICMP ping of
a given IP address (IP range bruteforce to be added later), or
DHCP responses.
