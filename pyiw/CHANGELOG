Version 0.3.3:
	- Looks like I forgot to actually add the codestuffs for CHANNEL and
	  MODE. I've added CHANNEL support for now (thanks to Robert Berger),
	  but I really need to revist this entire module. It's been more than
	  a year, I'm a much better coder now, and there's lots of room for
	  improvement. *sigh*
	- Added more TODO stuff in the source file.
	- Fixed a bug in where packaged 0.3.2 was reporting itself as 0.3.1.
	- We're using version 29 of iwlib (if you build statically), which
	  supports WE21.
	- Small changes to the test script.

Version 0.3.2:
	- Ooops! I was using IFNAMSIZ as the maximum value of an ESSID, when
	  I should have been just using the max buffer size. Thanks to 
	  Oliver Thuns for the heads up.
	- Upgraded to a beta'ish version of LIBIW.

Version 0.3.1:
	- Added a LICENSE file; LGPL.

Version 0.3.0:
	- Add support for WirelessExtensions 20 method of detecting whether
	  WPA is on a scan result or not (using IWEVGENIE).
	- Still need to change to attribute access rather than dictionary
	  access.

Version 0.2.2:
	- Removal of ETHTOOL includes and testing code.

Version 0.2.1:
	- "make static", er, uh, works right now.

Version 0.2.0:
	- Oops; made it so that the interface refeshes itself when you retrieve
	  values from the dict. This was a biggy, so I bumped to 0.2.0.
	- Added some experimental (commented out) code for using ETHTOOL and
	  getting the currently assigned IP address.

Version 0.1.2:
	- Fixed a silly bug w/ PyArg_ParseTuple and ->ifname.
	- Added a function to report the version of WE libiw is using.
	- Made the version stuff behave correctly.
	- Somewhat better error-handling; things throw sensible exceptions now.

Version 0.1.1:
	- Made _init bring the network interface up before operating on it.
	  This is particularly useful for Atheros cards, who need this in
	  a bad way.

Version 0.1.0:
	- First semi-psuedo-official release.
